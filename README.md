## Overview

 
## Problem Statement:
The problem is to create a basic Python program that can output text to the console.
I'm going to create a software using python3 and write a code that will displays "Hello, World, from Morris" to the console.

Research:
I don't really do any research because Python's have  built-in print function that can be used to output text to the console.

Hypothesis:
Using the print function, we should be able to print "Hello, World! from Morris " to the console.

Experimentation:

The print function was used to print "Hello, World! from Morris " to the console.

Conclusions:
The print function successfully printed "Hello, World! from Morris " to the console, confirming our hypothesis.

Purpose: 
The purpose of this software is to demonstrate a basic Python program for educational purposes. 
This can serve as a starting point for more complex Python programs.
